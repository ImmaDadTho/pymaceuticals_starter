In this Repository I have statiscal data and charts for an analysis into a 
pharmaceutical drug called Capomulin and its effect on squamous cell carcinoma 
compared to other pharmaceutical drugs. This analysis contains data from a 45 
day period where 249 mice that were identified with SCC tumor growth were treated
with different drug regimens. During those 45 days the drug regimens performance
were compared to that of Capomulin. 

This data includes:

- The raw data that we are going to be working on.

- Cleaned up the data and created tables which will generate the mean,median,variance,
  STD, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
   
- Created bar charts that will show the timepoints for all mice tested for each drug
  regimen.
  
- Created pie charts to show the percentage of male and female mice.

- Calculated quartiles, find outliers, and created a box plot for four of the drug 
  regimens Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
  
- Created a line plot from one of the mice to show the tumor volume during that time 
  period.

- Created scatter plot to show the the mouses wieght and tumor volume for the Capomulin
  treatment.

- Calculated the correlation and regression with the scatter plot to calculate if the 
  weight of the mouse had any correlation to the tumor volume, also generated a chart
  with a line regression to visualize this data.
